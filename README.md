# tsconfig.json
## Usage

Install as a dev dependency on a particular project:
```bash
yarn add -D @ziothh/tsconfig.json
npx @ziothh/tsconfig.json
```

Install globally (recommended if you are using typescript very often):
```bash
yarn global add @ziothh/tsconfig.json
# now you don't have to prefix this command with npx!
# you also don't have to specify the organisation name (@ziothh)
tsconfig.json
```
